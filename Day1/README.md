2.Collaboration: DevOps encourages better communication and conflict resolution between the development and operations teams.
3.Higher quality software: DevOps can assist in identifying and fixing faults and defects more quickly, leading to higher quality software, by utilising continuous integration and testing.
4.More agility: Because DevOps helps firms to swiftly build and distribute changes to their software, they can react to shifting requirements and priorities with greater ease.

What is Automation?
